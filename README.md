# Overview of Analysis:
## The purpose of this analysis is to help prepare Pewlett Hackard for the large number of upcoming retirements.  Through this analysis we have updated and consolidated PH’s database in order to easily identify upcoming retirements and employees that are eligible for their mentorship program.  By transitioning some of the upcoming retirement eligible employees to part-time mentors prior to their full retirement PH will be able to ensure that they have sufficient and appropriately trained staff in all departments to ease the transition of the large number of retirees.

# Analysis Summary:
## Pewlett Hackard is about to undergo significant and impactful staffing shortages as employees born between Jan. 1, 1952 – Dec. 31, 1955 retire.
In total PH will have 90,398 employees retire.  Of those who are retiring 31,175 are engineers, 28,254 are Senior Staff and 4,502 are Technique Leaders.  The current proposed Mentorship program has 1,549 eligible employees, which will leave a significant gap, particularly in Engineers, Senior Staff and Technique Leaders.
## In order to bridge the gap that the upcoming retirements will create there are several recommendations:
### 
  - Expand the mentorship program to include employees born between January 1, 1965 to December 31, 1969 in order to provide additional mentors, especially within Engineering, Technique Leadership and Senior Staff
  - Build additional resiliency in management.  Upcoming staffing shortages should be identified by segment leaders.  As there are currently two departments without managers, this creates undue stress on management team and does not allow for forward and strategic planning.  By implementing a management training program issues such as the “silver tsunami” are more likely to be avoided in the future.
  - Complete quarterly work force assessments.  Understand the number of vacancies that are foreseen by quarter and year in order to ensure there is sufficient time to onboard and train new employees.  This will minimize any negative impact of employee turnover.
